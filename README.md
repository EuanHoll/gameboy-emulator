# Gameboy Emulator

A Gameboy emulator made using C#. Currently abandoned, but may be revisited in the future. Most of the opcodes are implemented, but there is no visual output.

## Usage

To use the emulator, you will need to provide a ROM file for a Gameboy game. The emulator will then attempt to run the game. Please note that this emulator only supports the original Gameboy, and does not work with Gameboy Color or Gameboy Advance games.
